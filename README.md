# Project: Chicago Divvy Bicycle
## -- Station Behaviours Study and Future Usage Prediction
In this project, we will study the Chicago Divvy Bicycle Dataset.

1) We will classify the station according to their weekday and weenkend behaviours.

2) We will use time series analysis (HoltWinters Model) to predict the future usage of each station. At the end, a user interface will be provided, which allows the user to enter GPS and future time, and the model will return historicaly data and future prediction for nearby stations and plot a geographical graph.
